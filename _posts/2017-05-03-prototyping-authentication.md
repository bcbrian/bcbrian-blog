#### TL;DR [Auth0 for the win](http://auth0.com/)

---
When you are trying to build a new app there are a lot of things that you have to consider. One of those things is user authentication. In the software world there are a few options.

1. You can make your own. But you don't have time for that.
1. You can use some one else's implementation. I recommend [passport js](http://passportjs.org/)
1. You can use a SAAS (software as a service). 

Of these options the clear winner for me is a SAAS option.
Here is why. You will spend some of the most valuable hours of prototyping your app, that you do not even know if any really wants, on the user authentication which in most cases is not the key part of your app.

There are several options for SAAS user authentication. The clear winner for me has been [Auth0](http://auth0.com/)

##### Why Auth0

First lets get perspective we are prototyping an app and want to get it to users as quick as possible. While there is some setup for Auth0 their pricing for scaling you app is amazing!
